# AI Study Assistant Platform

## Project Overview
The AI Study Assistant is a full-stack web application that aims to assist students in understanding and revising their study materials more effectively. Students can upload their study materials or PDF files, and the system uses artificial intelligence to create summaries, explanations, and quizzes. The aim is to make studying more interactive and efficient rather than just relying on study notes.

## Problem Statement
Students usually have a lot of study material and find it difficult to revise or understand everything clearly. Study notes do not offer explanations, self-testing, or tracking of progress. This means that students usually take longer to revise but still feel unprepared.

## Proposed Solution
This platform enables students to upload their study materials and engage with them using AI. The platform can create summaries, answer questions, and create quizzes from the uploaded study materials. It also enables students to organize their subjects and track their learning progress over time.

The application uses the Google Gemini AI API to offer intelligent academic support based on the uploaded study materials.

## Key Features
- User registration and login
- Upload study material (PDF or text)
- AI-generated summaries of notes
- AI-based question and answer support
- Automatic quiz generation from content
- Subject-wise organization of materials
- Progress tracking dashboard
- Study history management

## System Scope
The backend system will handle user authentication, file storage, AI processing, quiz management, subject organization, and progress tracking. The frontend will provide an interactive interface for uploading materials, viewing AI outputs, and monitoring learning activity.

## Target Users
- Students (primary users)
- Admin (system monitoring and management)

## Technology Stack
Frontend: React  
Backend: Node.js with Express  
Database: MongoDB  
AI Integration: Google Gemini API  
Storage: Local or cloud file storage  

## Expected Outcome
The final system will convert static study materials into interactive learning materials, allowing students to learn quickly, test their knowledge, and track their learning progress with AI-powered assistance.
